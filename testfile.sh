Stage 2 Part B — Backend.im Deployment Infrastructure Proposal
Objective
The goal of this research is to design a simple, cost-effective infrastructure and workflow that allows a developer to move from writing backend code locally to having it deployed and live on Backend.im, using mostly open-source tools and minimal setup.
The vision is that a developer can simply run one command, for example, backendim deploy and have their code automatically tested, packaged, and deployed, all through a lightweight pipeline powered by the Claude Code CLI and standard DevOps tools.
1. Proposed Architecture
Overview
The system connects five key components:
Developer Machine
 Developers write code locally, assisted by the Claude Code CLI for generation and automation.
 They also have a small helper CLI (backendim) that wraps deployment steps.


Source Control System
 Code is stored on GitHub or GitLab, which triggers automated workflows when changes are pushed.


CI/CD Runner
 GitHub Actions (or another open-source CI tool like Drone or Jenkins) builds and tests the code, then packages it as a Docker image.


Artifact Registry
 Built images are pushed to GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) or Docker Hub, both of which are free and widely supported.


Deployment Orchestrator (Deploy Agent)
 A tiny webhook service or serverless function receives a deploy request from CI, authenticates to Backend.im, and triggers the actual deployment.


Backend.im
 The target hosting platform, which receives and runs the final artifact.


Architecture Flow
Developer → backendim CLI → GitHub Repo → GitHub Actions → Deploy Agent → Backend.im → Live App

Each arrow represents a small, automated hand-off — no manual clicking or SSH involved.

2. Tool Choices and Reasoning
Tool
Purpose
Why Chosen
Claude Code CLI
Generate deployment manifests, Dockerfiles, and CI configs from natural-language prompts.
Enables AI-assisted automation, reduces manual config.
GitHub Actions
Automate build/test/deploy on code push.
Free tier, easy setup, good integration with GitHub.
Docker & GHCR
Package and distribute application artifacts.
Universal format, directly usable by Backend.im.
Serverless Deploy Agent
Lightweight service that bridges CI and Backend.im.
Minimal infrastructure, low maintenance, pay-per-use.
backendim CLI (wrapper)
One-command UX for developers.
Keeps workflow simple and unified.
GitHub Secrets
Manage credentials securely.
Built-in and free, no extra service needed.


3. Local Setup Flow
Install Tools


Claude Code CLI


backendim CLI (pip install backendim or curl install)


Docker


Authenticate


Run backendim login to save your Backend.im API token securely.


Initialize Project


Run backendim init to create a minimal CI pipeline and environment template.


Deploy


Either push code to GitHub (which triggers the pipeline)
 or
 run backendim deploy locally to perform build and deploy.


Example Local Workflow
# Prepare manifests with Claude
claude code gen --template infra-deploy --out deploy/manifest.yaml

# Build and push Docker image
docker build -t ghcr.io/<user>/<app>:latest .
echo $GHCR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u <user> --password-stdin
docker push ghcr.io/<user>/<app>:latest

# Trigger Backend.im deployment via deploy agent
backendim deploy


4. High-Level Deployment Sequence
Developer runs backendim deploy or pushes to the main branch.


The CLI runs quick checks, builds a Docker image, and pushes it to the registry.


GitHub Actions picks up the push and runs tests.


CI sends a deploy request (image + metadata) to the Deploy Agent.


The Deploy Agent calls Backend.im’s API to roll out the new version.


Backend.im performs health checks and returns a status.


The Deploy Agent reports success or failure back to CI and the CLI.

5. Custom Code Required
backendim CLI — small open-source command-line tool (200–500 lines of code)


Handles login, config, and “one-command” deploy.


Deploy Agent — lightweight webhook or Lambda function (100–300 lines of code)


Receives POST requests from CI, authenticates to Backend.im, and triggers deploys.


CI Template — YAML file in the repo that defines the build/test/publish steps.


The rest uses off-the-shelf open-source tools.
6. Security and Credentials
Store secrets in GitHub Secrets (BACKENDIM_API_TOKEN, GHCR_PAT).


The Deploy Agent should verify each incoming request using an HMAC signature or GitHub token.


Use least-privilege access tokens.


7. Example GitHub Actions Workflow
name: Deploy to Backend.im
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}
      - name: Trigger deploy
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_AGENT_URL }} \
               -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_AGENT_TOKEN }}" \
               -d '{"image":"ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}"}'

8. Verification and Health Checks
After deployment, the Deploy Agent performs a simple health check:
Calls /healthz or /version on the new app.


Waits for a 200 OK response within a timeout period.


Reports success/failure back to CI.


If the health check fails, the CI pipeline fails, ensuring broken builds never go live.
9. Cost and Operational Considerations
GitHub Actions → Free for small workloads.


Serverless Deploy Agent → Practically free (only runs on demand).


Docker Hub / GHCR → Free public hosting or low-cost private repos.


Backend.im → Consumes existing credit/quota, no new infra required.


This approach is lightweight, scalable, and zero-maintenance for developers.
10. Summary and Outcome
The proposed workflow delivers:
A one-command deployment experience for developers.


Minimal custom code (a tiny CLI and webhook).


Full reliance on open-source and free tools.


Automatic testing, packaging, and deployment via GitHub Actions.


Seamless integration with Backend.im APIs.


With this setup, a developer can go from local development to live production in minutes, all orchestrated by Claude Code CLI and simple DevOps plumbing.
11. Suggested Next Steps
Implement a basic proof-of-concept Deploy Agent.


Package the backendim CLI and publish it as an open-source helper tool.


Extend the Claude Code CLI templates to generate backendim manifests automatically.


Test the flow end-to-end with a simple Node.js app and document the results.


12. Executive Summary
This proposal outlines a lightweight DevOps architecture that enables a “push-to-deploy” experience for Backend.im. It combines Claude Code CLI for configuration generation, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, GHCR for artifact storage, and a simple Deploy Agent to communicate with Backend.im. The result is a low-cost, mostly open-source solution that allows developers to deploy with a single command, keeping infrastructure overhead close to zero.
